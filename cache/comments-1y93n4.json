I kind of agree with regards to the recent movie reboot, the batman they have created - realistic, gritty does not fit *AT ALL* in the wider DC universe, it's completely preposterous.\n\n2. In regards to the old DC universe, the Justice League cartoon and earlier comics, utterly wrong. The batman of those days lived in a much more fantastic world. The super-ness of batman is only enhanced by being shown to go toe to toe with virtual demi-gods, as others have said here.

Except, Superman is generally a more reactionary hero than Batman, and doesn't seem to keep tabs on all the villians at large. And I can imagine Joker escaping at a time when Superman is busy fighting Braniac or General Zod or something, so he has to deal with the primary threat first. And of course, Superman would never outright *kill* the Joker. But you're right, in this respect, Batman would be a little more believable in a world without superpowers.\n\nHowever, I still don't think he would be a better *character* outside of the DC universe, because this would mean giving up the relationship between Batman and Superman, something I think is *foundational to both characters*.\n\nWhat makes Superman a great character? It's that, despite having the powers of a *fucking god*, he's always maintained his humanity. It's part of the reason it's so important for him to have a secret identity; without an \"ordinary\" life as Clark Kent, he'd soon loose touch with the concerns of \"ordinary\" mortals. Just read Kingdom Come to see what I'm talking about. Now, why does Superman have so much respect for humanity? Part of the reason is the way he was raised, of course, but the other reason is: Batman. Superman *admires* Batman for his courage, dedication, and convictions--in the superhero world, Batman is Superman's one link to humans, and he's a perpetual reminder of the abilities of \"mere mortals\". Batman keeps Superman humble. I don't think it's a coincidence that Batman and Superman don't team up in Kingdom Come.\n\nNow, what makes Batman a great character? You said it yourself: he's a self made man. It appeals to the best in us all. He wanted to become the greatest crimefighter known to man, and spent years training in order to make it happen. What else it great about Batman? His *obsession*. He is single-mindedly devoted to being Batman, and nothing distracts him from that task. Now, without any other superheroes, this is impressive enough. But add Superman to the mix, and it becomes *amazing*. Think about it: Batman lives in a world where a man can *fly, shoot heat rays, and kick criminals into orbit* and he *still* thinks to himself \"I must learn jiu jitsu, dress at a bat, and beat up petty criminals. I can make a *difference*. I can be **significant**.\" *That's* obsession. *That's* dedication. If Batman in the Nolanverse is impressive because he has become the most perfect crimefighter in the world, Batman in the DC universe is more impressive because he still *tries* to become the best crimefighter in the world, despite KNOWING HE WILL NEVER BE AS GOOD AS SUPERMAN.\n\nThe relationship itself is also fun to explore. There's an interesting dichotomy between Batman and Superman; I've heard it described as \"one is a god trying to be a man, the other a man trying to be a God.\" Superman puts an incredible amount of effort into maintaining a civilian life as Clark Kent, probably to the detriment of his crime fighting, because he *wants to be human*. Batman, meanwhile, often neglects his life as Bruce Wayne in order to be a more effective Batman; in fact, he frequently views his \"ordinary\" life as a distraction from his \"real\" life as Batman. Batman wants to lose himself in the role, to leave his \"human\" side behind as much as possible. So when Superman and Batman team up, they each see in the other something they want for themselves. I think it's one of the most fascinating relationships in comics.\n\nSo that's why Batman is better in the DC universe. The DC universe adds subtleties to Batman's character, and Batman grounds the DC universe. And the relationship between Batman and Superman is too good to give up.", "edited": 1392756439.0, "author_flair_css_class": " points", "downs": 40, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Okay, as far as &amp;quot;Superman should just beat the shit out of Joker every time he escapes&amp;quot; goes, I don&amp;#39;t have much of a response. Except, Superman is generally a more reactionary hero than Batman, and doesn&amp;#39;t seem to keep tabs on all the villians at large. And I can imagine Joker escaping at a time when Superman is busy fighting Braniac or General Zod or something, so he has to deal with the primary threat first. And of course, Superman would never outright &lt;em&gt;kill&lt;/em&gt; the Joker. But you&amp;#39;re right, in this respect, Batman would be a little more believable in a world without superpowers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, I still don&amp;#39;t think he would be a better &lt;em&gt;character&lt;/em&gt; outside of the DC universe, because this would mean giving up the relationship between Batman and Superman, something I think is &lt;em&gt;foundational to both characters&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What makes Superman a great character? It&amp;#39;s that, despite having the powers of a &lt;em&gt;fucking god&lt;/em&gt;, he&amp;#39;s always maintained his humanity. It&amp;#39;s part of the reason it&amp;#39;s so important for him to have a secret identity; without an &amp;quot;ordinary&amp;quot; life as Clark Kent, he&amp;#39;d soon loose touch with the concerns of &amp;quot;ordinary&amp;quot; mortals. Just read Kingdom Come to see what I&amp;#39;m talking about. Now, why does Superman have so much respect for humanity? Part of the reason is the way he was raised, of course, but the other reason is: Batman. Superman &lt;em&gt;admires&lt;/em&gt; Batman for his courage, dedication, and convictions--in the superhero world, Batman is Superman&amp;#39;s one link to humans, and he&amp;#39;s a perpetual reminder of the abilities of &amp;quot;mere mortals&amp;quot;. Batman keeps Superman humble. I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s a coincidence that Batman and Superman don&amp;#39;t team up in Kingdom Come.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, what makes Batman a great character? You said it yourself: he&amp;#39;s a self made man. It appeals to the best in us all. He wanted to become the greatest crimefighter known to man, and spent years training in order to make it happen. What else it great about Batman? His &lt;em&gt;obsession&lt;/em&gt;. He is single-mindedly devoted to being Batman, and nothing distracts him from that task. Now, without any other superheroes, this is impressive enough. But add Superman to the mix, and it becomes &lt;em&gt;amazing&lt;/em&gt;. Think about it: Batman lives in a world where a man can &lt;em&gt;fly, shoot heat rays, and kick criminals into orbit&lt;/em&gt; and he &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; thinks to himself &amp;quot;I must learn jiu jitsu, dress at a bat, and beat up petty criminals. I can make a &lt;em&gt;difference&lt;/em&gt;. I can be &lt;strong&gt;significant&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;quot; &lt;em&gt;That&amp;#39;s&lt;/em&gt; obsession. &lt;em&gt;That&amp;#39;s&lt;/em&gt; dedication. If Batman in the Nolanverse is impressive because he has become the most perfect crimefighter in the world, Batman in the DC universe is more impressive because he still &lt;em&gt;tries&lt;/em&gt; to become the best crimefighter in the world, despite KNOWING HE WILL NEVER BE AS GOOD AS SUPERMAN.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The relationship itself is also fun to explore. There&amp;#39;s an interesting dichotomy between Batman and Superman; I&amp;#39;ve heard it described as &amp;quot;one is a god trying to be a man, the other a man trying to be a God.&amp;quot; Superman puts an incredible amount of effort into maintaining a civilian life as Clark Kent, probably to the detriment of his crime fighting, because he &lt;em&gt;wants to be human&lt;/em&gt;. Batman, meanwhile, often neglects his life as Bruce Wayne in order to be a more effective Batman; in fact, he frequently views his &amp;quot;ordinary&amp;quot; life as a distraction from his &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; life as Batman.

He's way too entrenched there.\n\nSo I think the real question is: why does Batman even exist? \n\nThe TL;DR answer: He's a human hero for human readers.\n\nFor example, Batman's struggle with The Joker is not simply about the physical altercations themselves, but is also an ideological one. I think the Nolan films try to represent this (in a way), but if you read the comics (I'm not saying you don't) you get a much better sense of what The Joker is trying to do - which is to deconstruct Batman's (and society's) moral values. \n\nLet's work with the Nolan films for a moment. The second Nolan film presents a Joker that seeks to destroy Batman via exposure to nihilism - though, it's a nihilism that doesn't seek to construct new values on things. The Joker appears to just want to destroy the old values (however I think this could be up for debate). The most straightforward example of this would be towards the end when he gives the civilians and the prisoners the detonators for the bombs on each of the ships. \n\nBatman serves to demonstrate *why* we value what we value, or what purpose it serves. He struggles with moral issues in a way that is meant to reflect how we struggle ourselves. If Superman were to replace Batman, he would do exactly as you say - he would fly in, quickly dispatch The Joker, and make Lois some pancakes. However, what he wouldn't do is demonstrate why The Joker's way of thinking is destructive, or why it is morally reprehensible, or why we should reject it in favor of other ideologies. The Joker does not only attack society via physical harm, but he also attacks the minds of people, which I think is far more powerful and ultimately more dangerous than anything else (if our goal were to maintain the status quo). \n\nBatman is necessary to combat The Joker basically for the above reasons. He fights The Joker on an ideological battleground, which is something that Superman wouldn't (and maybe couldn't) do. Batman and Superman also have very different ideas regarding politics. \n\nAs an added note, Batman does find it necessary sometimes to put other superheroes in check - Superman in particular. I'm not going to open up the Batman vs. Superman debate, just trying to make sure we keep in mind that Batman is necessary in a lot of ways. \n\nAlso, as you already said, Batman exists in relation to other superheros in the DC universe.

A universe where the really big baddies get taken care of by the super-powered capes and the Batman takes on the psychopaths with exploding umbrellas and a horde of ninja, and when he needs more help because Darkseid stole his nano-bots, he teams up with the big guns. To make an analogy: RPGs don&amp;#39;t make guns useless, there are just times when you need a big bang or a sniper shot.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "link_id": "t3_1y93n4", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cfj9tcc", "created": 1392854550.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1392825750.0, "distinguished": null, "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "banned_by": null, "subreddit": "changemyview", "likes": null, "replies": "", "saved": false, "id": "cfje9gk", "gilded": 0, "author": "Broseidon_3", "parent_id": "t3_1y93n4", "approved_by": null, "body": "I was and still am a huge batman fan.
