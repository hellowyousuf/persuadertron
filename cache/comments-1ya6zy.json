I was raised on home grown vegetables, and there&amp;#39;s a very noticable difference in, for example, a store bought tomato and a home grown tomato of the same variant.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "link_id": "t3_1ya6zy", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cfjg3m6", "created": 1392867272.0, "author_flair_text": "6\u2206", "created_utc": 1392838472.0, "distinguished": null, "num_reports": null, "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "banned_by": null, "subreddit": "changemyview", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "banned_by": null, "subreddit": "changemyview", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "banned_by": null, "subreddit": "changemyview", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "banned_by": null, "subreddit": "changemyview", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "banned_by": null, "subreddit": "changemyview", "likes": null, "replies": "", "saved": false, "id": "cfjjhne", "gilded": 0, "author": "zacman76", "parent_id": "t1_cfj82no", "approved_by": null, "body": "Yeah I completely agree, I love bullshit.

However, sadly, It is much more common for food to be genetically engineered to taste better rather than be better for you. This is because better tasting food will sell better. Food that is engineered to taste better will almost never be better for you than the original. \n\nYes you can genetically modify food to make it bigger and produce more and this i agree with, however you can only do this up to a point, if you go to far with this the food will be ruined. Take for example corn; corn used to be this grass-like plant that grew in south america, however through selective breeding (I.E. which seeds got eaten and distributed) it grew into the form commonly known as maze like our common corn, but smaller and more bitter. Now to my point, scientists have genetically engineered corn to have massive kernels, much larger than we normally see. However this was unsustainable because not only could the plant not support the corn, but it required more sun and water than it could get. Organic corn is superior to this because it will eventually adhere to its main food source, humans and become big enough to be sustainable to the environment and make enough food to be profitable, where as genetically engineered corn advances at a pace faster than the environment is able to take. \n\nI can see why people see pesticides as a good thing, however they are in no way good for the environment. \nFirst lets look at the short term consequences, essentially what pesticides will do is wipe out all of the bugs and such at the bottom of the food chain. This topples the entire thing causing things higher on the food chain to die, because the small birds and rodents that lived off of eating those bugs will lose their food and their population will fall and this will happen through out the food chain. \nSecondly the long term effects, you may wonder why farmers have to use pesticides every year, this is because when they use pesticides some bugs are resistant to it, and these bugs breed and spread more than the other bugs, because they are alive. Eventually you get a whole ecosystem of bugs that are resistant to this form of pesticides. Because of this the farmers and scientists have to come up with a new form of pesticides that will kill this new strand of bugs. In the meantime all of these chemicals that they are using are accumulating in the ground, and while alone they might be fine for humans they are not so good when they are combined. \n\nWhen you don't use pesticides on crops you don't run into these problems. You will have more pest trouble but your soil will not be saturated with chemicals.\n\nNow i am not saying that there are no uses for chemicals in food, for example giving antibiotics to sick livestock which is not organic, but obviously better for your food.

Organic corn is superior to this because it will eventually adhere to its main food source, humans and become big enough to be sustainable to the environment and make enough food to be profitable, where as genetically engineered corn advances at a pace faster than the environment is able to take. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can see why people see pesticides as a good thing, however they are in no way good for the environment. \nFirst lets look at the short term consequences, essentially what pesticides will do is wipe out all of the bugs and such at the bottom of the food chain. This topples the entire thing causing things higher on the food chain to die, because the small birds and rodents that lived off of eating those bugs will lose their food and their population will fall and this will happen through out the food chain. \nSecondly the long term effects, you may wonder why farmers have to use pesticides every year, this is because when they use pesticides some bugs are resistant to it, and these bugs breed and spread more than the other bugs, because they are alive. Eventually you get a whole ecosystem of bugs that are resistant to this form of pesticides. Because of this the farmers and scientists have to come up with a new form of pesticides that will kill this new strand of bugs. In the meantime all of these chemicals that they are using are accumulating in the ground, and while alone they might be fine for humans they are not so good when they are combined. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you don&amp;#39;t use pesticides on crops you don&amp;#39;t run into these problems. You will have more pest trouble but your soil will not be saturated with chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now i am not saying that there are no uses for chemicals in food, for example giving antibiotics to sick livestock which is not organic, but obviously better for your food. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "link_id": "t3_1ya6zy", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cfjtlsu", "created": 1392894474.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1392865674.0, "distinguished": null, "num_reports": null, "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "banned_by": null, "subreddit": "changemyview", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "banned_by": null, "subreddit": "changemyview", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "banned_by": null, "subreddit": "changemyview", "likes": null, "replies": "", "saved": false, "id": "cfjhxev", "gilded": 0, "author": "Indon_Dasani", "parent_id": "t1_cfiyq0c", "approved_by": null, "body": "The CDC's primary concern is the use of antibiotics in animals, because they're potential carriers for diseases that can jump a species gap and infect humans.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": "points ", "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC&amp;#39;s primary concern is the use of antibiotics in animals, because they&amp;#39;re potential carriers for diseases that can jump a species gap and infect humans.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "link_id": "t3_1ya6zy", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cfjhxev", "created": 1392870808.0, "author_flair_text": "16\u2206", "created_utc": 1392842008.0, "distinguished": null, "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "saved": false, "id": "cfiyq0c", "gilded": 0, "author": "Cartastrophe", "parent_id": "t1_cfisvim", "approved_by": null, "body": "Organic apples are sprayed with tetracycline and streptomycin to control for fireblight.\n\nAntibiotics are used extensively in organic agriculture.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Organic apples are sprayed with tetracycline and streptomycin to control for fireblight.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Antibiotics are used extensively in organic agriculture.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "link_id": "t3_1ya6zy", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cfiyq0c", "created": 1392812640.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1392783840.0, "distinguished": null, "num_reports": null, "ups": 4}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "saved": false, "id": "cfisvim", "gilded": 0, "author": "Indon_Dasani", "parent_id": "t3_1ya6zy", "approved_by": null, "body": "The overuse of antibiotics in agriculture [is a major factor in the production of pathogens which resist human antibiotics](http://www.cdc.gov/drugresistance/threat-report-2013/pdf/ar-threats-2013-508.pdf#page=36).\n\nNon-organic food is murdering you, personally, one evolution at a time.\n\nEdit: Well.
