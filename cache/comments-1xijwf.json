Untruth, keeping truth at bay, would be better for man than truth. It would not be the truth that would set him free, but rather he would have to be freed from the truth. Man would be more at home in the dark than in the light. Faith would not be the good gift of the good God but instead an affliction. If this were the state of affairs, how could faith give rise to joy? Who would have the courage to pass faith on to others? Would it not be better to spare them the truth or even keep them from it? In the last few decades, notions of this sort have discernibly crippled the disposition to evangelize. The one who sees the faith as a heavy burden or as a moral imposition is unable to invite others to believe. Rather he lets them be, in the putative freedom of their good consciences.\n\nThe Catholic notion is that one is judged based on how the manner in which one follows one's conscience, but in our view conscience is not merely self-referential (i.e. the individual does not determine what is right and wrong), but bears reference to a greater and objective Truth: God.\n\nIn the Catholic worldview it is possible for non-Catholics to enter heaven (and Ratzinger observes [elsewhere](http://www.amazon.com/Salt-Earth-Millennium-Interview-Seewald/dp/0898706408) that this must be a very frequent phenomenon) precisely because all people carry within themselves the primordial memory of the good, called \"anamnesis.\" In grounding oneself upon this primordial memory of goodness encountering us, it is possible to live a just and moral life even outside the formal boundaries of the earthly Church.\n\n(Incidentally it is for this reason that it is possible to condemn people like Hitler. He does not get a free pass to heaven simply because he \"did what he thought was right\"; no, like all people, deep within him was the primordial memory of the good, the instinctual understanding of right action. He can be condemned precisely because he chose to *ignore* the good within himself).\n\nAnamnesis is the basic, obvious, and often-forgotten orientation of the human person toward the good. If indeed this is so, then all human beings naturally long for the good, whose self-expression is the Christian religion: Christianity reflects the goodness of God. Thus Christianity ought not be seen as a heavy burden, but rather as the conduit to goodness itself and thus to the fulfillment of the human person: in encountering Christianity, though one might already be good in character, one is able to exclaim, \"That's it! That is what my nature points to and seeks.\"\n\nThus our natural inclination toward the good finds its satisfaction in the truth of the good encountering us (namely, the Christian religion). Indeed it is true that salvation is very much possible for those who are not formally Catholic because they strive for the good, but nevertheless if the Truth is their end as human beings, then they ought to encounter it in its fullness. Truth is what satisfies them, truth is what sets them free, and thus it is right to evangelize.\n\nThus ignorance is not a free pass. Rather, salvation is offered to those who *attempt* to strive toward the truth, toward goodness, toward love, even if they do not make it all the way, so to speak. It is in the act of allowing anamnesis, the basic understanding of the good, to inform our life journeys that enables the possibility of salvation.

Why should God save any of us at all? &amp;amp; how is it any more arbitrary to pick the saved based on their attitude to him than it is to pick them by how they treated their own, or what colour hair they had or whether they had children or not, or whether they ate meat?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If such a God exists then the criteria for salvation he picks are the criteria, there&amp;#39;d be no point in deciding they were unfair &amp;amp; condemning others by choosing not to give them the opportunity to meet them. You&amp;#39;d hardly call it fair to put your own moral vanity ahead of other people&amp;#39;s souls; I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s fair that ships sometimes sink, but that doesn&amp;#39;t mean I&amp;#39;d be justified in refusing to hand out life-jackets if I was present at a ship-wreck &amp;amp; happened to have some. In the kind of world-view we&amp;#39;re talking about, damnation &amp;amp; salvation are just simply facts, exactly the same as any other danger.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, I may be reading too much into what your saying in this next paragraph, so ignore this if I am, but I&amp;#39;m getting the impression that you&amp;#39;re saying that the realisation that the god one believes in is unfair should be reason for doubt. That would be a complete nonsequitur since whether or not something is fair does not have any impact on whether or not it&amp;#39;s real, so to leave one&amp;#39;s religion because one thinks damnation is wrong would be as pointless as giving up a healthy lifestyle because one believes sickness is wrong.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "link_id": "t3_1xijwf", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cfbs8fr", "created": 1392055897.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1392052297.0, "distinguished": null, "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "banned_by": null, "subreddit": "changemyview", "likes": null, "replies": "", "saved": false, "id": "cfbye4b", "gilded": 0, "author": "mis4mike", "parent_id": "t3_1xijwf", "approved_by": null, "body": "Institutions need mechanisms to spread their ideology.
