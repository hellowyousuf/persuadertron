I do think that it is \"good\" that we have laws that make piracy illegal in principle, even if these laws are difficult to enforce, and I don't always agree with how they're enforced when they are. But I think that the legality of piracy is pretty much a totally separate issue than what your CMV is about.\n\n**Financial Harm** - Most of the discussion here seems to be about the extent to which piracy causes any financial harm. If I create something and you pirate it, I'm not actually *losing* anything, so where's the harm. This actually isn't the main angle I'd use to approach the morality of piracy, but there is a point I think is important. You claim that you \"wouldn't\" have bought it anyway and have described the product as having some value relative to other priorities in your life (food, clothing, etc) and that there's a disconnect between this value and what the listed price of the software is. This justifies your belief that you wouldn't have bought it anyway, as it didn't have enough value. This is all fine, but I **don't** think you can honestly claim that your value assessment of the product is not affected by the possibility of pirating it for free. The mere fact that torrenting it is even an option that your considering reduces the value of the product, and thus unfairly raises the bar for what you're willing to pay for. So indirectly, I'd argue that the way piracy affects your value judgments and purchasing decisions *does* result in actual list sales for content right near the threshold of what you'd be willing to buy. You can *maybe* wiggle out of this if the buyer is **extremely** honest and self-aware, but in general, I'm really skeptical that anyone can really honestly be sure of what choices they'd make *if* piracy wasn't on the table.

Throughout history we have acknowledged the creators and given them control over what they created. \n\nOnly since the industrial revolution; prior to that, written works were regularly duplicated by anyone with the ability and access to it. In Alexandria (Egypt) the law was that any books or scrolls brought into the city could not be taken out again until they had been copied for the library. \n\nBack then, you made money on the execution of the idea, not merely having an idea. The first patents were not even granted to the inventors, but rather to whichever company had the favor of the monarch. When the printing press was invented (no patent needed for that one to be profitable, BTW) copyright was put in place not as a service to authors but as a means to suppress unwanted, heretical books. \n\nLater, more modern copyrights were given to authors, in the midst of much debate. It was argued that the public domain would suffer and all knowledge would be owned and the cost of education would skyrocket. The idea was sold to the public (who formerly had the right to copy books they owned) by limiting the monopoly to a short period after first publication. This period [was ratcheted up](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2f/Copyright_term.svg/625px-Copyright_term.svg.png) over the years to ensure that works can never enter the public domain.\n\n&gt;Should I be able to take what you have created (the schematics) and distribute it to the world?\n\nIn my opinion, yes. I think that the free flow of ideas and information is a force for good, even if it reduces the profits of the author of the information. I think patents and copyrights as they stand today hold back innovation and education in exactly the way that those who argued against them feared; the cost of bringing a product to market is astronomical because anyone with a similar product wants to sue you for violating their patent. So you have to get a patent of your own stipulating in what way yours is different, and now you have an interest in keeping your product the same as well as an obligation to sue others who make similar products to yours... and the cycle goes on and on.\n\nThe cost of textbooks are a good example of how the copyright system leads to inflated prices and increases the barrier to entry for education.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 2, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The act of creation gives certain rights. Throughout history we have acknowledged the creators and given them control over what they created. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Only since the industrial revolution; prior to that, written works were regularly duplicated by anyone with the ability and access to it. In Alexandria (Egypt) the law was that any books or scrolls brought into the city could not be taken out again until they had been copied for the library. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Back then, you made money on the execution of the idea, not merely having an idea. The first patents were not even granted to the inventors, but rather to whichever company had the favor of the monarch. When the printing press was invented (no patent needed for that one to be profitable, BTW) copyright was put in place not as a service to authors but as a means to suppress unwanted, heretical books. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Later, more modern copyrights were given to authors, in the midst of much debate. It was argued that the public domain would suffer and all knowledge would be owned and the cost of education would skyrocket. The idea was sold to the public (who formerly had the right to copy books they owned) by limiting the monopoly to a short period after first publication. This period &lt;a href=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2f/Copyright_term.svg/625px-Copyright_term.svg.png\"&gt;was ratcheted up&lt;/a&gt; over the years to ensure that works can never enter the public domain.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Should I be able to take what you have created (the schematics) and distribute it to the world?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, yes.
