I&amp;#39;ll repeat again that southern pride has been closely tied with racism in the past, and enjoyed a revival when that core aspect of the south was challenged. If racism and segregation are core aspects of southern pride that cause many southerners to display this pride when they are being dismantled, then you can&amp;#39;t separate it too far from racism in 1960. Nowadays, it might well be different, but you simply can&amp;#39;t claim that it&amp;#39;s origins aren&amp;#39;t a problem if you also think that racism is a bad thing.

No. I will attempt to explain why.\n\nFirst, I agree that the states rights are not disassociable from the aim of preserving slavery in the South and are a euphemism for the *cause* of Southern secession. But a war is not a singular, timeless event where every party is fighting for the same reason. The reasons for war evolve and not every Southern soldier had a direct stake in the preservation of slavery. Just as not every American soldier had a stake in the Iraq war. Just as we cannot honestly condemn every single German citizen who wasn't actively smuggling Jews as an evil genocider. War, ideology, and violence are not simple and reducing them does little to gain insight into the nature of humanity to commit evil.

Though the South went to war to preserve slavery, the North did *not* go to war to end slavery: the North went to war to *prevent secession.* Did this goal evolve over time leading to the Emancipation Proclamation? Yes.

It is important to understand the mindset of Germans before and during the Nazi regime.

To be shameful of your past is also to have to look at the &amp;quot;prideful&amp;quot; side of it and be proud of who you are. That is why many do use it. To call the Confederate flag slavery-supporting is also call the American flag the same. The North, as many know, that their own fair share of slaves. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, I agree with the second, that is a group of people we know as &amp;quot;fuckin&amp;#39; idiots.&amp;quot; They are much like those that are ignorant enough to claim that all southerners are racist, except they are racist. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "link_id": "t3_1yec0n", "score_hidden": false, "name":
