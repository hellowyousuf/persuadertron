The first is to do with morality - the hero is moral, the villain is immoral. The second meaning is to do with the character's structural position in the story. This second meaning has nothing to do with morality - it is simply to do with from whose perspective we experience the story. In this second meaning, 'hero' is almost synonymous with 'protagonist' (though contains connotations of 'acting' - a passive hero is what we might call an anti-hero). Walt is always the protagonist in Breaking Bad, so he is technically always the hero - the tragic hero. It's very much the same way we call Macbeth the hero of the play *Macbeth*. He's not moral - quite the opposite - but he's the protagonist, so he is the hero of the play. The antagonist is the character who opposes the hero. \n\nIt gets a bit complicated with 'villain', because of the way that word has changed over time. Nowadays, whereas hero has two meanings: (1: protagonist - such as we are using here, 2: an altruistic/moral person) and it's fine to use both (as long as you clarify which you're using), villain doesn't really have that same inter-changability. Macbeth and Walt are tragic heroes, but Macduff and Hank are not villains. It's better just to call them antagonists. They antagonise the protagonist.\n\nSo in conclusion - you are both correct and incorrect. In moral terms, Walt could be seen to start as the hero (doing things for his family) and turn into a villain.
