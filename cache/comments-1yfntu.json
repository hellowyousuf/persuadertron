My wife's sister is dangerously ill. She's been committed four times and attacked several people including my wife since that original post. The mental health system keeps releasing her after a week despite her having told the psychiatrist that she wants to shoot up a university. We live less than an hour from Virginia Tech and she once told me that she would upstage Cho and I would know it when I saw her mugshot on national TV. She has no affiliation with the school whatsoever - she just thinks she could quote, do better.\n\nI don't know if she would ever shoot strangers. I don't think so. I think she is just trying to scare us. But she HAS attacked several individuals including her own sister. After that attack we got a restraining order, and she got a fine plus 20 hours of community service. She is also under investigation in another state for stalking some guy she met on facebook. She broke into his house and rubbed cat feces in his bed.\n\nI hope I am wrong, but I can imagine her shooting at us, or her father, or one of the people she is fixated on. She occasionally fixates on strangers like her dentist or physician, both of whom she decided were trying to kill her secretly or sterilize her. Suffice to say I do not want this person to ever get her hands on a gun, though she regularly asks me to buy her one or where to find one.\n\nI THINK her involuntary commitments should stop her from getting a gun from a reputable dealer but she can still buy from a private buyer. I have bought from a private owner outside a gun show myself so I know she could do the same if she ever thought of it.\n\nThe thing I want to add is that: \n\n&gt; but illegal items are almost always easily obtainable. \n\nOn account of illness she is totally illogical and anti-social and incompetent. She does not have \"connections.\" She doesn't know drug dealers or petty criminals. She does not have friends who are close enough to help her out or even let her in their home where she could steal a gun. She is not capable of stealing from Wal-Mart or LGS. She is not logical enough to think of a clever way to get around the laws.\n\nIf sales were restricted just a tad more I am almost certain she would never get a gun. She could always cause trouble with a car or gasoline and matches, true, but she really likes the idea of a gun. She romanticized it. So even as a 2A supporter, I hope that the gov soon restricts private sales. Yes, it sucks and is inconvenient, but I think it would stop a few crazies. So long as we law abiding citizens are not denied our rights, it is OK to face a little inconvenience in my book.\n\n.\n\nTLDR: Just because SOME psychos will be able to get their hands on a gun no matter what, doesn't mean we shouldn't try to make it more difficult for them. I know a person who is dangerous and crazy, but not competent enough to steal a gun or find an illegal source.

She does not have &amp;quot;connections.&amp;quot; She doesn&amp;#39;t know drug dealers or petty criminals. She does not have friends who are close enough to help her out or even let her in their home where she could steal a gun. She is not capable of stealing from Wal-Mart or LGS. She is not logical enough to think of a clever way to get around the laws.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If sales were restricted just a tad more I am almost certain she would never get a gun. She could always cause trouble with a car or gasoline and matches, true, but she really likes the idea of a gun. She romanticized it. So even as a 2A supporter, I hope that the gov soon restricts private sales. Yes, it sucks and is inconvenient, but I think it would stop a few crazies. So long as we law abiding citizens are not denied our rights, it is OK to face a little inconvenience in my book.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TLDR: Just because SOME psychos will be able to get their hands on a gun no matter what, doesn&amp;#39;t mean we shouldn&amp;#39;t try to make it more difficult for them. I know a person who is dangerous and crazy, but not competent enough to steal a gun or find an illegal source. Right now, I am hoping she never realizes how easy it is to buy privately.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "link_id": "t3_1yfntu", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cfkjz5w", "created": 1392968048.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1392939248.0, "distinguished": null, "num_reports": null, "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "banned_by": null, "subreddit": "changemyview", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "more", "data": {"count": 2, "parent_id": "t1_cfkp36v", "id": "cfl2xil", "name": "t1_cfl2xil", "children": ["cfl2xil"]}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "saved": false, "id": "cfkp36v", "gilded": 0, "author": "sbbh3", "parent_id": "t1_cfk6c36", "approved_by": null, "body": "It depends on how much you want a fire arm and who you know.

To me, that&amp;#39;s almost a trick question like asking whether 20 pounds of feathers or 20 pounds of lead is heavier; a gun homicide is no worse than a knife (or any other type of) homicide.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "link_id": "t3_1yfntu", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cfk92f0", "created": 1392946118.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1392917318.0, "distinguished": null, "num_reports": null, "ups": 6}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "saved": false, "id": "cfk7koa", "gilded": 0, "author": "Neckbeard_The_Great", "parent_id": "t1_cfk5cgh", "approved_by": null, "body": "You can't look at a single incident and say \"Well, it didn't work.\" Norway has about a tenth the gun deaths per capita of the USA.^[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_firearm-related_death_rate) While that is likely due in part to cultural differences, I suspect that it is also contributed to by the difficulty in obtaining guns.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": "points ", "downs": 2, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can&amp;#39;t look at a single incident and say &amp;quot;Well, it didn&amp;#39;t work.&amp;quot; Norway has about a tenth the gun deaths per capita of the USA.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_firearm-related_death_rate\"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; While that is likely due in part to cultural differences, I suspect that it is also contributed to by the difficulty in obtaining guns.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "link_id": "t3_1yfntu", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cfk7koa", "created": 1392942967.0, "author_flair_text": "1\u2206", "created_utc": 1392914167.0, "distinguished": null, "num_reports": null, "ups": 9}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "saved": false, "id": "cfk5cgh", "gilded": 0, "author": "Kaluthir", "parent_id": "t1_cfk2uh9", "approved_by": null, "body": "Do you think gun control prevents psychos from getting guns?

Most hunters use rounds that are more high powered than anything the military uses for anti-personal purposes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So that AR-15, yeah, its not a high powered rifle. But that deer hunting rifle your grandpa uses?  Yeah, thats a lot more powerful, and loaded with more deadly ammunition than what the military is issuing riflemen.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "link_id": "t3_1yfntu", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cfk87zk", "created": 1392944355.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1392915555.0, "distinguished": null, "num_reports": null, "ups": 14}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "banned_by": null, "subreddit": "changemyview", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "banned_by": null, "subreddit": "changemyview", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "banned_by": null, "subreddit": "changemyview", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "banned_by": null, "subreddit": "changemyview", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "banned_by": null, "subreddit": "changemyview", "likes": null, "replies": "", "saved": false, "id": "cfkbo8u", "gilded": 0, "author": "Wyo-Patriot", "parent_id": "t1_cfkbbg1", "approved_by": null, "body": "True...

I don't think that firearms are the cause of the violence,  instead violence is a result of certain cultural views and norms within America.\n\nTurn on your TV and you are inundated with shows about violence (action movies, UFC fights, boxing, etc.) or sports that are violent by nature (American football). Chuck Norris, Sylvester Stallone, Arnold Schwarzenegger, etc. are all held in high regards because of what they represent culturally: the American badass that never backs down from a fight and always wins. I say this not to point my finger at violent programming or videogames, but instead to say that entertainment reflects American culture. \n\nAmerican culture is exceptionally brash, valuing brutal simplicity of thought and action. We simple answers to our questions, especially in regards to politics and religion, and anything that seems more nuanced is viewed almost suspiciously. Game of Thrones and House of Cards do so well with American audiences because, despite the nuances, the main character(s) is (are) brutal, cutthroat individuals that use their wits to outmaneuver and outclass their opponents. Most of the time with threats of force or threats of great consequence. Again, culture. All this to say is that more firearms does not equate to more violence or a greater fear of violence necessarily, especially in the hands of most citizens.\n\nI recently returned from Japan on a study/training mission and I observed a few things about their culture - they are community based, they all follow the rules to the letter for the most part even when no one is watching, and their police usually swarm if they are ever called out. Most of their crime is white collar fraud type and not violent agg assault. Their controls on firearms work because of their strict control on weapons (since ancient times) and because of their culture. Very few of them are violent, and the ones that are tend to be social outcasts/punks/etc.\n\nWhere things get scary is when there is a serial killer on the loose, or someone like the DC 'sniper' - the hidden/unknown threat of violence committed by one human to another is frightening to everyone as a whole. An individual who kills 30 or even 80 people for whatever reason is the worst kind of human being in many peoples' views. These are total tragedies that galvanize support for a specific action (such as gun control laws), yet when 100,000 people die in a tsunami, or millions are killed by a regime that brainwashes its citizens, most don't even bat an eye, or if they do, it's a facebook status. Nothing more. This is because willful human violence is so scary, so terrifying as to bring absolute fear into many. Many in America carry firearms because of this - because the phrase \"why did it happen here? That stuff never happens here! We are a quiet town with no crime!\" is all too common in these tragedies.\n\n\n\nI'm going to jump off my high horse about the hypocrisy of people and move on...\n\nTo address your points further...\n\nPolicing in America is an interesting animal. We are not trained to \"control the situation at any cost whatsoever\" - we are trained to maintain situational awareness of our surroundings, engage individuals in conversation to ascertain the facts as best we can tell of events, and provide a report supported by various observations, at which point detectives take over and analyze the case and pursue the criminal. In critical situations where a shooting is occurring, we rush on scene, observe the threat, orient ourselves to the threat, decide on a course of action, and then act on that course of action in order to disrupt the plans of the individual in question.\n\nYour level of knowledge regarding our priorities is misaligned - We are only single-track minded in a few instances, and that is during an active shooter scenario, where the priority is \"stop the threat to human life NOW\"\n\nThere are a few bad apples in the LE world - you will see many on the news, and most Americans will draw the conclusion that all cops are fat/lazy/power hungry/assholes that only wish to abuse their power and inconvenience you. It also doesn't help that the average person's regular dealings with LE is in traffic stops, where they get a ticket.\n\nI, and other officers, treat everyone with the same level of respect in accordance with the law - I presume that you are innocent until you are proven guilty (by observable actions, warrants, probable cause, etc.), even if  you are a career criminal. Very few LEO's view people in the way that you think. They usually have short careers.\n\nI assume that everyone has a firearm, because even if firearms were illegal, there would be a few that possessed them and would be willing to use them. People have utopian ideals about firearms control until they put on any kind of uniform and have to interact with the dregs of humanity on a day to day basis. criminals in America will always have access to firearms because smuggling into the US is easy. Look at how well the war on drugs is going.\n\nRemember the cultural aspect to Americans? Double it to gang culture. If no one has firearms effective for their own defense, people will be easy pickings, and LE is 5-10 minutes away depending on where people live. And if you use a cell phone and can't get your location/address out to dispatch, then the best GPS coordinates dispatch gives the patrol officer responding to your call are within 30 meters of your actual position, and if you live in a multi-story apartment complex...door to door checks.\n\nFirearms are a universal equalizer - the 14 year old girl is powerless against 3 big guys that try and bust into her house while her parents are away...unless she is a champion shotgun shooter and has access to her firearm, in which case one of the bad guys dies, one is severely injured, and the last guy runs away (true story). Home invasions in the UK have spiked every since firearms were highly regulated, and even if someone has a firearm, using it to defend oneself and their home usually is met with murder charges.\n\n\n\nI have a huge beef with the whole \"resisting\" thing. Most people misunderstand and do not realize what the officers or the individual that officers are trying to take into custody are doing. Most of the time (there are exceptions), the individual failed to comply, became violent when police tried to take them into custody, and try to subdue the individual. Have you ever tried to handcuff and place a person in the back of a car? It takes more than one person to do if the other person is actively fighting it. Isolating an individual limb takes quite a bit of force, and many times individuals have to be struck in nerve areas (major muscle groups for the most part) in order to minimize their ability to hurt police. I have hit someone with a baton, full force, in both quads, and the dude ran away - no he was not on PCP - but slowed down real fast shortly thereafter (it's a delayed reaction). This is where the videos usually start, after the initial confrontation, and after the suspect bit/kicked/punched/attacked/whatever to an officer.\n\nMost of the time, the video does not capture or most people don't see the suspect kicking out at the officers in question, or actively struggling to break out of a hold of some kind.\n\n\n\nI'll tell you what is scary - sitting in a college classroom with one exit and what sounded exactly like a staccato of gunfire go off in the room next to me and my only weapon being a flashlight. That's scary. I arm myself, however, not because of irrational fear, but a realistic expectation that there are a host of individuals who wish you harm. My primary weapons to counter them are a combination of verbal judo, verbal escalation (hey buddy, can you back up? - Back up, man. - Back up! - BACK THE FUCK UP!!! No, it is not instantaneous, if they continue to approach my verbal requests will escalate), circling off of a person's line of approach (if a person is approaching you, circle off of their line of approach and verbally ask them to stay back in an escalating fashion if they continue to approach). This will dissuade 99.99% of potential criminals. The .01% that continue are the ones that you should be worried about. Most of the time, criminals are looking for a quick fix of cash or whatever, it's the few that persist in trying to close the distance that you should be worried about.\n\nBlanket statements about the \"vicious cycle\" of firearms races ignore the very real metrics on the ground. Many say that police are militarizing unnecessarily, but the California bank shootout, where the criminals had illegally obtained machineguns and body armor, and the police only had .38 spc caliber revolvers. Police realize a lack in capability and wish to enhance officer safety, so they may buy larger, better body armor, or they may get M4's and patrol rifles to respond to the threat of school shootings and long range engagements, allowing more standoff distance and greater accuracy, or they may get an APC from military surplus because they need to be able to pull doors off their hinges or pull down walls to gain entry in a hostage/man with a gun situation.\n\n\n\n\n\ntl;dr: More guns doesn't equal more crime.
