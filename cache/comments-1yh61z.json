First, I am not misogynist. Originally following this statement with &amp;quot;I am a woman myself&amp;quot; was not me saying that me being female is proof I am not misogynist. It was so it could be clear that my post was coming from the point of view of a female-- they were two individual thoughts. I do not think women are inferior to men. I do not think stereotypes should be regarded as true and encouraged by society. My general claim about the brain differences in terms of hemispheres is something I learned awhile ago, and apparently is just a myth that has been proved false. The &amp;quot;source&amp;quot; I provided was something I just googled and skimmed through, assuming it proved my previous knowledge. I apologize for not examining the study more carefully and realizing that it didn&amp;#39;t really prove anything at all. However, that really isn&amp;#39;t important to my central argument. There are so many &amp;quot;sources&amp;quot; that point at contradicting conclusions. I can find a study that supports my claim, and you can find one that directly refutes it. So I don&amp;#39;t really care what shit you think backs your claim up,  realistically if there was one straight answer about any of this there would be no point in even talking about it. ALL I was trying to say is that, hypothetically, if all opportunity was completely equal and there was no moral or social obligations to align to a particular gender; things would not be fifty fifty. There would be more men in the army, and there would be things women would be much more inclined to do. A lot of my post was interpreted as me justifying stereotypes when that really was not what I meant to do. I wasn&amp;#39;t saying that I think it&amp;#39;s okay that it&amp;#39;s socially less acceptable for a man to woman, but that&amp;#39;s the truth and I am just acknowledging that I think it is based in logic. All I was trying to say was that the stereotypes we have are based in logic and are not entirely untrue. This isn&amp;#39;t defending stereotypes, or saying that they don&amp;#39;t further encouraging sexism. I do not think there is justification for sexism. I think that men and women should ALWAYS have equal opportunity. That&amp;#39;s all. Oh, and I just want to say that it&amp;#39;s really fucking annoying that people who are inept at providing a valid point instead turn to demanding sources and nitpicking the shit out of a word or sentence that everyone knows wasn&amp;#39;t the main point of that person&amp;#39;s argument. Arguing with someone about a slightly wrong use of a word, even though if you have a goddamn brain cell you know what they intended to say, detracts from the overall argument, makes you look like an asshole, and is a waste of time to read. Again, I&amp;#39;m sorry for not being clear in my original argument and sloppily wording my opinion in away that led it to easily be misinterpreted.

I think that they are claims that researchers have made.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;for centuries Europeans came up with scientific reasons that Africans and indigenous peoples were genetically less intelligent&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is not enough to debunk other research. It&amp;#39;s also not a popular opinion, but the shift in opinion has largely been due to politics changes, not changes in the research. There are also still some researchers who hold onto ideas that you would call &amp;quot;scientific racism.&amp;quot; The reality is that we don&amp;#39;t know enough about genetics to rule out differences between races.

From there, how can we remove differences we see later in life from cultural influence (and when we do cross-cultural studies, we do see a considerable influence of culture on individuals)? Different sizes in certain regions is interesting, but if environmental influence can change functioning/increase ability and decrease ability when certain areas are not used why is this significant to any one individual person? Furthermore, we&amp;#39;ve demonstrated with studies like the blue-eyed brown-eyed study that negative stereotypes about groups you belong to absolutely can influence confidence/scores in areas your group is considered &amp;quot;weak&amp;quot;; this also makes it difficult to separate environment from ability. Ex. in countries with high equality factors, women score far more &amp;quot;equally&amp;quot; with men on standard math tests. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Basically, there are more genius and moronic men than women.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is this correct? From my understanding, IQ is a measure of how quickly one can learn. It would be possible to have a high IQ and be unaccomplished or &amp;quot;moronic&amp;quot;. Why factor out motivation, innate interest in various subject matters that are valued by society, etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "link_id": "t3_1yh61z", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cfkmj6s", "created": 1392973847.0, "author_flair_text": "7\u2206", "created_utc": 1392945047.0, "distinguished": null, "num_reports": null, "ups": 8}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "banned_by": null, "subreddit": "changemyview", "likes": null, "replies": "", "saved": false, "id": "cfky343", "gilded": 0, "author": "tishtok", "parent_id": "t1_cfkm3jl", "approved_by": null, "body": "Actually, IQ is most strongly correlated with different brain areas in men and women. \"Cortical thickness in frontal regions correlates more strongly with intelligence in females, whereas temporal-occipital cortical thickness shows a stronger correlation with intelligence in males\" ([Deary, Penke &amp; Johnson, 2010](http://www.iapsych.com/articles/deary2010.pdf)). \"Apparently, males and females can achieve similar levels of overall intellectual performance by using differently structured brains in different ways\" (Deary, Penke, &amp; Johnson, 2010).

As far as nursing goes, there&amp;#39;s actually a shortage of nurses in a lot of countries, so more and more men are applying and being accepted into nursing school to help fill the void.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT:  According to &lt;a href=\"http://journals.lww.com/ajnonline/Fulltext/2013/01000/Men_in_Nursing.26.aspx\"&gt;this paper&lt;/a&gt; a lot of people feel that social pressure is a big issue facing men in nursing.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "link_id": "t3_1yh61z", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cfko6aq", "created": 1392977667.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1392948867.0, "distinguished": null, "num_reports": null, "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "banned_by": null, "subreddit": "changemyview", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "banned_by": null, "subreddit": "changemyview", "likes": null, "replies": "", "saved": false, "id": "cfkspkj", "gilded": 0, "author": "DeltaBot", "parent_id": "t1_cfkrpig", "approved_by": null, "body": "Confirmed: 1 delta awarded to /u/DashingLeech. ^[[History](/r/changemyview/wiki/user/DashingLeech)]\n\n^[[Wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/deltabot)][[Code](https://github.com/alexames/DeltaBot)][[Subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/DeltaBot/)]", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": "points", "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Confirmed: 1 delta awarded to &lt;a href=\"/u/DashingLeech\"&gt;/u/DashingLeech&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;sup&gt;[&lt;a href=\"/r/changemyview/wiki/user/DashingLeech\"&gt;History&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[&lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/deltabot\"&gt;Wiki&lt;/a&gt;][&lt;a href=\"https://github.com/alexames/DeltaBot\"&gt;Code&lt;/a&gt;][&lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/DeltaBot/\"&gt;Subreddit&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "link_id": "t3_1yh61z", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cfkspkj", "created": 1392988482.0, "author_flair_text": "\u221e\u2206", "created_utc": 1392959682.0, "distinguished": "moderator", "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "saved": false, "id": "cfkrpig", "gilded": 0, "author": "shiny_fsh", "parent_id": "t1_cfkmw4w", "approved_by": null, "body": "\u2206 I'd always been in favour of the \"equal opportunities\"/merit-based system being the eventual goal of gender equality, but hadn't considered what kind of equilibrium that might end up looking like and what unintended effects it could have.

Those often aren't clear.\n\nFirst, that men and women are equal doesn't mean they are identical. This is a message lost on lost of people on both sides of arguments. \"Equality\" is *supposed* to mean \"equal opportunity\" (level playing field) and not \"equal outcome\" (tied score). Unfortunately you are correct that some people interpret it as the latter.\n\nFor example, when people point out differences in income, that's a difference of outcome and is not a demonstration of a non-level playing field. You have to demonstrate absolutely everything else is statistically identical, both direct and indirect. Direct factors including things like education, years of experience, hours worked, output achieved, etc. Indirect factors include things like risk-taking behaviour, persuasiveness, negotiating abilities, and so forth. For example, it's fairly well established than men are statistically bigger risk takers, and with very good natural selection pressures for this tendency to be likely genetic, and women tend to be more average. This means you should expect more men at the top and bottom of society, which you do, but given the hard limits at the bottom of zero income and minimum wage, this would tend to result in bigger risk takers having higher average income. Even with the same average, a wider bell-curve distribution means the top end (and bottom end) will be dominated by the risk-takers.\n\nIt's also a mistake to focus on *capability*. Lots of study on that, but it is unnecessary. Rather, are more direct tendency to consider is *motivation*. That men are just as functionally capable of taking care of people doesn't mean we genetically get as much pleasure from it. Likewise, that women are as genetically capable of technical work does not mean they are genetically driven to get as much pleasure from it as men, statistically speaking. And there are very good reasons, again, why our genetic likes and dislikes should have different natural selection pressures, with plenty of empirical evidence across cultures, time, and species.\n\nThat all being said, that can explain why men and women can have different outcomes, such as engineering being male-dominated and nursing being female-dominated. (Culture doesn't explain it, since women have taken over many previously male-dominate jobs like accounting, advertising, biological sciences, and various fields of medicine.)\n\nHowever, as a systems dynamics expert, I do have to ask the question of what happens over time with these different outcomes within the framework of a democratic and capitalist society. If men \"legitimately\" tend to make more money, that money gives them more things in life like political influence, better education, more pleasure, better health coverage, and so on. If most of the people at the top of society (as well as bottom) tend to be men, even \"legitimately\", then men tend to make the rules and will tend to do so in their own favour simply because they don't experience life as a woman. (That is, it could be entirely unintentional and sub-conscious.)\n\nIs such a society a good one for women to live in, one that benefits men more because of its structure combined with men's innate tendencies that differ from women's? From a purely democratic point of view of people voting for policies in their own best interest, shouldn't women statistically vote more for policies that recognize this difference and adjust for it? And since women make up slightly more than 50% of the voters, shouldn't such policies win more often.\n\nI realize this is just a thought experiment and people don't truly vote based on such considerations, but I do think it is something to consider. \n\nPut another way, if the playing field starts level but one team keeps winning, even by merit, but each win tends to tilt the playing field a little in their favour, don't we need to keep resetting the field level to ensure it stays fair? Yet we also don't want to force a tied score because that isn't fair either. And that's the difficulty of our societies. The slope of the field is tied to the score to a greater degree than we talk about.\n\nThere are no easy answers here.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": " points", "downs": 5, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Definitions are highly important, as well as goals.
