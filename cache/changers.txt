Why would you believe these are the only two options? 

A completely scriptural view is that purgatorial weak universalism is the actual means with which God chooses to save the world, for example, in Christianity. Or that, in Buddhism, you'll literally reroll until you get the facts straight. In Islam, when the second coming rolls around, everyone gets a second chance, face to face with God, to recant their sins and believe.

Also, you misunderstand religion. Religion isn't about the end goal â€“ not for any of the mainstream religions. All the mainstream ones are purely about both orthopraxy, or how to live a good life, and orthodoxy, or what to believe.

Okay, here's my take, broken into a few sections:

**Legality** I don't think this is what you're talking about, but I thought I'd mention it briefly anyway. When we're talking about legality, we might talk about what "rights" a person or entity has or doesn't have. We might also lump together people as single faceless business entities. I do think that it is "good" that we have laws that make piracy illegal in principle, even if these laws are difficult to enforce, and I don't always agree with how they're enforced when they are. But I think that the legality of piracy is pretty much a totally separate issue than what your CMV is about.

**Financial Harm** - Most of the discussion here seems to be about the extent to which piracy causes any financial harm. If I create something and you pirate it, I'm not actually *losing* anything, so where's the harm. This actually isn't the main angle I'd use to approach the morality of piracy, but there is a point I think is important. You claim that you "wouldn't" have bought it anyway and have described the product as having some value relative to other priorities in your life (food, clothing, etc) and that there's a disconnect between this value and what the listed price of the software is. This justifies your belief that you wouldn't have bought it anyway, as it didn't have enough value. This is all fine, but I **don't** think you can honestly claim that your value assessment of the product is not affected by the possibility of pirating it for free. The mere fact that torrenting it is even an option that your considering reduces the value of the product, and thus unfairly raises the bar for what you're willing to pay for. So indirectly, I'd argue that the way piracy affects your value judgments and purchasing decisions *does* result in actual list sales for content right near the threshold of what you'd be willing to buy. You can *maybe* wiggle out of this if the buyer is **extremely** honest and self-aware, but in general, I'm really skeptical that anyone can really honestly be sure of what choices they'd make *if* piracy wasn't on the table. But I'll concede that if you have a really large bold **IF** qualifying your claim, maybe there's no financial impact.

**Morality** - But like I said, that's not really the angle I'd use to argue that piracy is immoral. That's actually a lot simpler the way I see it. I'm a human being, and if I work hard and create something, I might **want** you to pay me something in exchange for reaping the benefits my hard work. Its not about "rights"; Those are for the lawyers. Its about you respecting my wishes as one human being to another. Simple as that. If I work hard at something and then you completely ignore how I request you to treat my work and use it without my permission, that's kind of a dick move. Period.

And *if* the game of thrones producers or the folks at adobe *don't* mind you pirating their stuff, the moral concern dissipates. But that's not always the case, and when its not, you need to be honest about how you are or aren't respecting their wishes as human beings.

Definitions are highly important, as well as goals. Those often aren't clear.

First, that men and women are equal doesn't mean they are identical. This is a message lost on lost of people on both sides of arguments. "Equality" is *supposed* to mean "equal opportunity" (level playing field) and not "equal outcome" (tied score). Unfortunately you are correct that some people interpret it as the latter.

For example, when people point out differences in income, that's a difference of outcome and is not a demonstration of a non-level playing field. You have to demonstrate absolutely everything else is statistically identical, both direct and indirect. Direct factors including things like education, years of experience, hours worked, output achieved, etc. Indirect factors include things like risk-taking behaviour, persuasiveness, negotiating abilities, and so forth. For example, it's fairly well established than men are statistically bigger risk takers, and with very good natural selection pressures for this tendency to be likely genetic, and women tend to be more average. This means you should expect more men at the top and bottom of society, which you do, but given the hard limits at the bottom of zero income and minimum wage, this would tend to result in bigger risk takers having higher average income. Even with the same average, a wider bell-curve distribution means the top end (and bottom end) will be dominated by the risk-takers.

It's also a mistake to focus on *capability*. Lots of study on that, but it is unnecessary. Rather, are more direct tendency to consider is *motivation*. That men are just as functionally capable of taking care of people doesn't mean we genetically get as much pleasure from it. Likewise, that women are as genetically capable of technical work does not mean they are genetically driven to get as much pleasure from it as men, statistically speaking. And there are very good reasons, again, why our genetic likes and dislikes should have different natural selection pressures, with plenty of empirical evidence across cultures, time, and species.

That all being said, that can explain why men and women can have different outcomes, such as engineering being male-dominated and nursing being female-dominated. (Culture doesn't explain it, since women have taken over many previously male-dominate jobs like accounting, advertising, biological sciences, and various fields of medicine.)

However, as a systems dynamics expert, I do have to ask the question of what happens over time with these different outcomes within the framework of a democratic and capitalist society. If men "legitimately" tend to make more money, that money gives them more things in life like political influence, better education, more pleasure, better health coverage, and so on. If most of the people at the top of society (as well as bottom) tend to be men, even "legitimately", then men tend to make the rules and will tend to do so in their own favour simply because they don't experience life as a woman. (That is, it could be entirely unintentional and sub-conscious.)

Is such a society a good one for women to live in, one that benefits men more because of its structure combined with men's innate tendencies that differ from women's? From a purely democratic point of view of people voting for policies in their own best interest, shouldn't women statistically vote more for policies that recognize this difference and adjust for it? And since women make up slightly more than 50% of the voters, shouldn't such policies win more often.

I realize this is just a thought experiment and people don't truly vote based on such considerations, but I do think it is something to consider. 

Put another way, if the playing field starts level but one team keeps winning, even by merit, but each win tends to tilt the playing field a little in their favour, don't we need to keep resetting the field level to ensure it stays fair? Yet we also don't want to force a tied score because that isn't fair either. And that's the difficulty of our societies. The slope of the field is tied to the score to a greater degree than we talk about.

There are no easy answers here.

Jesus, you need a change of scenery.

Firstly, I think you need to consider your attitude to the people around you. Some of them are probably genuinely bad and would hurt you. Others may be indifferent to your feelings, which is not the same as being bad or wanting to hurt you. In fact, what they do could have no consideration of you at all. Is that them being bad or you being a little self-centered and expecting the behavior of everyone else to match your standards? A third group may love you, or at least like you, and want good things for you.

Your mention of the YouTube video is, to me, trivial and a poor example of the behavior of society. The internet affords people anonymity, which can lead to behavior that would not translate into "real life." I can make fun of an amateur singer on YouTube, but I wouldn't do it if she was performing on the sidewalk somewhere.

Selfless acts occur all the time. Parents are incredibly selfless by the very nature of child rearing. People volunteer across the country. I held the door for a bunch of people today (how great am I?). Although small, those type of things are nice and qualify as selfless.

I think you need to reassess the people around you. It sounds like you are either being too harsh and have an unrealistic interpretation of what makes someone bad or you are just extremely cynical and are looking for ways to characterize others are harmful to you.

I think you are making a conflation between a conceptual unit and a delivery unit.

Taken to your logical conclusion you might argue that each page in any textual literature must take advantage of the page nature of the medium. So each page of the great gatsby must contain a completeness that embraces its pageness just like each episode of The Wire MUST have a completeness that embraces its episode-ness.

Sometimes though it takes a few pages to build up to those epic lines, dialog and scenes that we all remember In the book. Not every page can be a work of literary genius compact into itself, nor should it be. We don't go to a random page (after having read the novel) to read something that captures some essence of the book on EVERY page. We go to pages 203-205 where our favorite dialog between the protagonist and the love interest occurs.

Sometimes the leg work to get to those epic 3 pages with layers of depth and meaning takes 30 pages from when the protagonist first encounters the obstacle preventing him from being with the love interest and we get a sub plot involving the backstory.

But each of those 30 pages had to encapsulate something individually... What stress to be a writer. Just because I write poetry doesn't mean each poem has to be a hiku of the exact words I have to fit on a page. Pages are just a delivery method set in a series to deliver a story.

So the work should be judged by the conceptual units chosen by the author not the delivery units they are limited to. Sure maybe it would be cool if where each page is perfectly sized to the story being told on it: page one is letter sized, page two is post card sized, page three is an a2, page four is a fold out the size of a large map. But that is an unreasonable burden on the artist. He does not want to tell a story dictated by the size of paper her can get a printer to print on.

You seem to reject the idea of a tv show that is really just a long movie (13 hour seasons or 55 hours long go a series lets say) but why? The episode length in this case is just an artifact of delivery consistency, like the choice of size of paper. It's not intrinsically relevant to the work if the artist does not want it to be and the consultant delivery does not unduly burden most viewers.

A perfect example is movie reels. Movies used to come in reels of physical film and many early films had a certain formula based on which reel you were in. The love scene on reel 3 the chase on reel 5 always finish by reel 8. That's fine but following or breaking that formula does not make a film better or worse. There are Hindi movies that still follow that sort of formulaic style, between reel 3-4, 6-7 9-10  there is always obligatory dance scenes even if it breaks the flow of the story the first half of the movie before intermission has a sort of completeness to it, and the last half is sort of complete to itself too, with an obligatory dance scene.

But reels are outdated now, the technology has moved on and continuous films of whatever length the author wants are accepted. Now that there is digital there is no physical "reel" and the pacing of the movie has more to do with what the viewers can handle in length and other style concerns.

I think that what you are viewing with "The Wire" is the same maturation of the mediums. With the web I am sure you will get serial "shows" with drastically different  episode lengths that each stand on their own much better. From an episodes measured in scores of second to episodes hours long for the same series.

But for now even the "Not TV" that is HBO must fit the delivery mechanism into formats that are roughly consistent. This goes much more for ad driven formats.

But personally is rather the artist tell the story they want to tell as best they can given delivery constraints. That means some stories are episodic and some are something else.

This is exactly the problem. History is complex.

If the North didn't fight against slavery but rather secession, even if the South fought for slavery AND secession; the subsequent battles over federal and state jurisdiction involving segregation are going to have some complex historical baggage, possibly involving some historical symbols being dug out of the attic.

Especially in light of a large proportion of people's great-grand-fathers living in the area might have *lost a war* even if they had no stake in slavery. It is feasible that albeit **misguided** Southern pride, entangled with a sense of state/cultural independence might be a complex part of their identity.

I don't see why this is that hard to understand or *must* be equated with *all* people flying *all* Confederate flags.

&gt;I believe that many people who display the confederate flag now do so out a sense of pride. That is not necessarily racism, though that pride does seem rather sickly if its modern roots from 50 years ago are in opposition to civil rights.

This is a pretty much very shortened summary of exactly my point. No one is saying that the roots of Southern pride are squeaky clean at all. 

It sounds like I *have* been addressing this directly for you if you've arrived at essentially the same conclusion as I have been explaining.

The problem is that there is no way to change your view, because it's still about definitions.

Perhaps, reading between the lines, you mean something like:

* It's wrong to enslave and treat as pets animals that wouldn't come back to you if not caged

or

* There's no point in having companion animals that won't come back to you

or

* I think that animals that wlll come back to you make much better pets than those that have to be caged
----
So, why do you use a different definition? What do you call a "pet" turtle or goldfish? Everyone else calls them pets. Why do you discount them as pets, as opposed to calling them a different type of pet? I just don't get why you made this post...

The will of the people is always free to be persuaded, and it often is.  There is nothing wrong with republican safeguards like limits and appointees, they add stability to the democratic principle.  (Judges shouldn't be politicians, for example).

I'd say you are quite wrong about how those social movements were successful, they relied completely on political support.  The people who enacted them were chosen to do so, simply because they had to use force to ensure the freedoms were protected does not mean it was counter-democratic.  There is always a backlash with reform, but I wouldn't consider any of them majoritarian.

Strong democracies have the requirement to bend to public will, which allows for maximum flexibility and stability.  Other systems ignore public will, and can turn on a dime if they so wish.

It it better for a society to punish sociopathic behaviours than it is to support them because we want other people to have empathy for us. 

That said - I am not sure how you characterise *your* sociopathy.

I googled "who is a sociopath" and I got this:

https://www.google.com/search?q=who+is+a+sociopath&amp;oq=who+is+a+soci&amp;aqs=chrome.1.69i57j0l5.2797j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;espv=210&amp;es_sm=93&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=who+is+a+sociopath


Antisocial personality disorder is a mental health condition in which a person has a long-term pattern of manipulating, exploiting, or violating the rights of others.

Perhaps you don't do any of this but by your own admission 

&gt; I simply do not have empathy for others

Well - in any ethical system you have to ask the fundamental question "why be ethical". The answer for that cannot lie in ethics itself, and the answer most of the time is simply "because we feel empathy".

Now - clearly you don't - so in your system - unless an action benefits you why would there be a need to be ethical? That's a scary thought because there are many instances where rational self interest is often not the ethical thing to do. 

To that end - I think it would be foolish on my part to have only sociopath friends because it benefits me to have people who feel empathy towards me around me. 

Now I do think that people's behaviour ought to be punished and not just people for who they are, but I am sure your sociopathy has led to at least some unfortunate situations. 

You admit 

&gt; and i have gotten much better at reading my families emotions. 

And I'm not sure - but I would think this made your life easier because your behaviour might have been more in line with people's expectations of you. Then again - it does require effort - so perhaps not.

BUT - as you get better at it - the effort required will reduce - that should be a fairly good reason to at least try to understand what people expect out of you.

I hope this isn't too hurtful - it isn't meant to be a personal attack. And while you do call yourself a sociopath - it doesn't preclude you feeling empathy for yourself.
----
I'm not saying you should feel bad about it.  In fact, I think you shouldn't. My personal feeling is that nobody should feel bad about something that's beyond their control.

That said, society has its reasons for portraying sociopathy this way.  It's probably badly misunderstood and portrayed badly in the media, but it does present a risk to society per se, regardless of the overreaction.

Lets say my wife files for divorce.  The last call on her phone is from a man she worked with, whom I never liked.  To me, this is proof that he's the reason she left me, so I kidnap, torture and kill him.  I followed my own ideals and morals, but:

* I was wrong about the facts of the case
* What I perceived as an appropriate punishment would be considered excessive to virtually everyone.

Should I be beyond condemnation?

If that doesn't work for you, here's another approach.  You can certainly argue that an Aztec priest who performed human sacrifice shouldn't be condemned because he was following his religion.  But the difference is the context.  Aztec culture and morality supported this view.

But in Hitler's day, the general consensus was that slavery was wrong, murder was wrong, imprisonment without wrongdoing was wrong, theft was wrong.  In the context of his culture, his views were unquestionably immoral. 

Unless you are arguing that as long as I *really believe* that I have a right to take your car, rape your daughter, and dismember your mother it's moral, then there needs to be some objective, mutually agreed upon morality, which Hitler unquestionably violated.

I feel bad for your loss. 

While studies indicate that [a small minority of repeat offenders make up the majority of the DWI cases](http://www.uscourts.gov/uscourts/federalcourts/pps/fedprob/2011-12/risk.html), in several municipalities interlock systems have proven effective in reducing significantly DWI recidivism rates. I would argue that a combination of such technological fixes, raising the legal liability of those who loan their vehicles out to DWI repeat offenders, and aggressive legal prosecution (including harsher sentencing for repeat offenders) would be an alternative fix to the DWI recidivism problem, one with many fewer negative effects than the system you propose. After all, someone who is going to be a repeat DWI offender is likely not going to allow minor technicalities such as an ability to get a driver's license stop them from driving again, so your proposed fix is probably going to be less effective than you might hope. 

On the flip side, I know people who were prosecuted for DWI as high school students with barely illegal limits of alcohol in their blood and who caused no accidents at the time. With age (and spending time in the pokey) came wisdom and they've had no problems in the decades since. Punishing a minor for the next sixty years over a bad decision made early in life is not a measured response--we don't even do this with first degree murder in many cases. It seems that better would be to target the true chronic DWI drivers, the minority who make up most of the instances of DWI.
