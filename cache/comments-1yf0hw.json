Basically, some people seem to think I&amp;#39;m saying that to be good, an episode of TV should\na) have as little narrative relation to other episodes in the series as possible, such that episodes can be watched in any order;\nb) more generally, depend as little as possible on knowledge of the season or series as a whole; and\nc) end with the status quo restored.\nNone of this is what I&amp;#39;m saying. In comments like &lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1yf0hw/i_believe_that_being_episodic_generally_makes_a/cfjzcqt\"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; I use &lt;em&gt;Breaking Bad&lt;/em&gt; as an example of a highly arc-based TV show that still meets all my criteria for being episodic. Please read that comment before making an argument on this subject.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s my impression that, probably since around the time that &lt;em&gt;The Wire&lt;/em&gt; became incredibly critically acclaimed, the idea has been circulating that the greatest dramatic television is &amp;quot;novelistic.&amp;quot; The attitude is usually presented something like this: For most of the history of television drama, stories were contained to single episodes, which resulted in a pretty formulaic structure--for instance, police procedurals where every episode introduces a villain who is caught by the episode&amp;#39;s end, only to resolve the status quo so the whole thing can happen again next episode. But then came ambitious, literary-minded shows like &lt;em&gt;The Wire&lt;/em&gt;, which told long stories over seasons, and didn&amp;#39;t pander to audiences who just wanted to be entertained for an hour.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, I absolutely agree that making use of continuity is a good thing. Earlier episodes should inform our understanding of later episodes. Moreover, I also agree that there&amp;#39;s no need to return to the status quo every episode. That said, I feel like in their attempts to embrace continuity and reject the return to a status quo, at least some TV ends up making incredibly formless and uninteresting episodes. I&amp;#39;ll continue to use &lt;em&gt;The Wire&lt;/em&gt; as my example.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In any given episode of the &lt;em&gt;The Wire&lt;/em&gt;, we&amp;#39;ll see many stories going on at once. Sometimes two will intersect in some way; sometimes they won&amp;#39;t. Sometimes the themes of one will clearly relate to the themes of another; sometimes they won&amp;#39;t. By the end of the season, of course, most of the stories will have intersected either narratively or thematically, but this isn&amp;#39;t the case on the level of episodes. Furthermore, many of these stories can be described as &lt;em&gt;continuations&lt;/em&gt; of events in past weeks; there is nothing to differentiate them from those events except the fact that they&amp;#39;re happening later. This is to say that much of the episodic construction of &lt;em&gt;The Wire&lt;/em&gt; is pretty arbitrary. There&amp;#39;s rarely much to comment on about a single episode; all we can really talk about is where the story is now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The problem for me is that construction is typically what makes a narrative work really interesting. By treating episodes as only pieces in one large story (the season), the show loses the opportunity to makes the episodes themselves interesting as works of art. The best art should make the most of its medium and embrace its constraints and limitations; by not considering the episode as the basic unit of television, &lt;em&gt;The Wire&lt;/em&gt; inevitably loses the opportunity to &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; anything with its &amp;quot;TV-ness.&amp;quot; At best this is a missed opportunity. There is nothing really satisfying about rewatching one particular episode of &lt;em&gt;The Wire&lt;/em&gt;, not because it has a bad story, but because it&amp;#39;s only part of a larger story. It&amp;#39;s like opening a novel (even a great novel) at random and reading twenty pages: it will probably be very enjoyable, but only because you&amp;#39;re submerging yourself in a world you enjoy and spending some time there; it&amp;#39;s nothing like the satisfaction gained from reading a great short story, which begins and ends.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is not to say that &lt;em&gt;The Wire&lt;/em&gt; was not a good show, nor that it never made good episodes. The problem, though, is that the really good episodes are pretty much just the episodes with big plot developments, typically (though not exclusively) the last two episodes of the season. To fans of &lt;em&gt;The Wire&lt;/em&gt; (or &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt;, which is structurally very similar to &lt;em&gt;The Wire&lt;/em&gt;), do you ever really feel like re-watching &lt;em&gt;particular&lt;/em&gt; episodes of the show that don&amp;#39;t involve major plot developments? It&amp;#39;s obviously very well made in many respects, so I can fully understand just wanting to watch &lt;em&gt;an&lt;/em&gt; episode, but do you ever want to watch one episode in particular that doesn&amp;#39;t contain a very memorable plot development? (This is different from wanting to watch a particular scene, which I can understand easily.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wire&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt; are probably the two biggest offenders in this department, in my opinion, at least among highly acclaimed shows that I&amp;#39;ve seen. (I sometimes hear this description applied to &lt;em&gt;Boardwalk Empire&lt;/em&gt; as well, but I don&amp;#39;t watch that show, so I couldn&amp;#39;t comment. &lt;em&gt;Oz&lt;/em&gt; also seems like it could be an example, but it was never nearly as acclaimed as these other shows, and, in my opinion its structure better resembles traditional soap operas than this mode of &amp;quot;novelistic&amp;quot; TV.) If you could convincingly argue that in fact either &lt;em&gt;The Wire&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt; really &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; embrace the episodic format, that would change my view as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(Please note again that I am not saying that arcs are bad and that all episodes should be &amp;quot;standalone.&amp;quot; I think shows like &lt;em&gt;The Sopranos&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Mad Men&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Breaking Bad&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Lost&lt;/em&gt; (at least the earlier seasons, and sporadically for the whole run), and occasionally &lt;em&gt;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&lt;/em&gt; are all examples of great, highly &amp;quot;episodic&amp;quot; TV shows that also regularly had season- and series-long arcs.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(Also, if in your response you feel compelled to say that &lt;strong&gt;Baltimore&lt;/strong&gt; was really the main character of &lt;em&gt;The Wire&lt;/em&gt;, man, please first ask yourself if this is really bolstering your argument or if you&amp;#39;re merely repeating a very tired critical cliche because you think it sounds good.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit&lt;/strong&gt;: I realize that you may want to respond by saying that this is just a matter of taste, or some version of &amp;quot;it&amp;#39;s all subjective.&amp;quot; I guess I would just say that if you don&amp;#39;t believe there&amp;#39;s any real way to judge a work of art&amp;#39;s quality outside arbitrary personal preference, it&amp;#39;s not really in the scope of this discussion to argue that here. It&amp;#39;s sort of like someone saying, e.g., &amp;quot;I believe it&amp;#39;s immoral to send your children to private school,&amp;quot; and someone else responding, &amp;quot;Well, nothing is really right or wrong, because there&amp;#39;s no God, and if God doesn&amp;#39;t exist, then everything is permitted.&amp;quot; It may be the case, but it is by no means self-evident, lots of intelligent people disagree, and it&amp;#39;s almost definitely not going to lead anywhere interesting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Okay, I&amp;#39;ve awarded a delta.

Overall, I feel that they are used in much the same way at similar frequencies.\n\n&gt;There is a benefit to an episodic structure, because it makes individual episodes more interesting (do you deny this?) without making the season or series as a whole less interesting.\n\nIt does make each individual episode more interesting, but I disagree that it doesn't make the rest of the series less interesting.  Most shows that I have watch that use a primarily episodic structure I get bored with after a few episodes.  Given, I usually watch shows as an archive binge rather than one episode at a time, but what I usually find with episodic shows is a often don't have any motivation to continue watching, while arc based shows will grab my attention and have me scrabbling to play the next episode.\n\n&gt;Again, I'm not opposing episodic shows to arc-based shows.

I thought you were advocating purely or at least nearly so episodic shows such as police procedurals.  What it seems you are actually arguing for is a balance between episodic and arc based.  \n\nEven so, I still prefer the non-episodic method of story telling because it makes the story flow more smoothly when watching a whole season at once.  Episodic shows can feel disjointed and jarring when every hour has a new story.  I much prefer the feeling of a show being a \"10 hour movie\", as *Game of Thrones* has been described, rather than a collection of shorter stories.\n\n&gt;Also, The Odyssey is a really strange example to choose here, because it's about as episodic as it gets--hence the division into episodes.\n\nIt's been a while since I read it, and I remember it flowing pretty smoothly between each part.

Overall, I feel that they are used in much the same way at similar frequencies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There is a benefit to an episodic structure, because it makes individual episodes more interesting (do you deny this?) without making the season or series as a whole less interesting.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It does make each individual episode more interesting, but I disagree that it doesn&amp;#39;t make the rest of the series less interesting.  Most shows that I have watch that use a primarily episodic structure I get bored with after a few episodes.  Given, I usually watch shows as an archive binge rather than one episode at a time, but what I usually find with episodic shows is a often don&amp;#39;t have any motivation to continue watching, while arc based shows will grab my attention and have me scrabbling to play the next episode.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Again, I&amp;#39;m not opposing episodic shows to arc-based shows. Probably every non-episodic show will be arc-based, but an episodic show can be arc-based (like Breaking Bad) or non-arc-based (like a million police procedurals, or something more ambitious like the first season of Enlightened). Breaking Bad tells just as much of a unified story as The Wire, but each episode (for the most part) is also its own story.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think I understand your argument better now.  I thought you were advocating purely or at least nearly so episodic shows such as police procedurals.  What it seems you are actually arguing for is a balance between episodic and arc based.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even so, I still prefer the non-episodic method of story telling because it makes the story flow more smoothly when watching a whole season at once.  Episodic shows can feel disjointed and jarring when every hour has a new story.  I much prefer the feeling of a show being a &amp;quot;10 hour movie&amp;quot;, as &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt; has been described, rather than a collection of shorter stories.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Also, The Odyssey is a really strange example to choose here, because it&amp;#39;s about as episodic as it gets--hence the division into episodes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s been a while since I read it, and I remember it flowing pretty smoothly between each part.

Programming feed to providers.\n\n&gt; Ad Supported Cable Networks:\n\n&gt; Customers: Same customers as the broadcast TV networks, but currently reversed in importance. Carriage fees are more important to most (all?) ad supported cable networks than is advertising revenue.  \n&gt; Product: Viewers (various age/gender demo groups) to advertisers. Programming feed to providers.\n\n&gt; Premium Cable Networks: (HBO, Showtime, etc)\n\n&gt; Customers: Primarily subscribers, but carriage providers as well, who act as the \"retailers\" of their product.  \n&gt; Product: Programming.\n\n&gt; TV Studios:\n\n&gt; Customers: Broadcast and cable networks, both for first run and syndication. DVD buyers. Online streaming companies (Netflix, Hulu, Amazon, etc).  \n&gt; Product: TV programs.\n\n\nSo they do not have to ensure that you are coming back after each episode on a very specific day at a very specific time.

A very interesting article in that regard:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2014/02/05/broadcast-tv-viewers-youre-not-the-customer-youre-the-product-being-sold-2/234774/\"&gt;http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2014/02/05/broadcast-tv-viewers-youre-not-the-customer-youre-the-product-being-sold-2/234774/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The laments from commenters that broadcast television networks &amp;quot;need to listen to their customers&amp;quot; typically betray a fundamental misunderstanding of the relationship between broadcast TV viewers and broadcast TV networks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Viewers are not the broadcast networks&amp;#39; customers, they&amp;#39;re the networks&amp;#39; product.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How do the customers and products stack up in TV land?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Broadcast TV Networks:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Customers: Traditionally advertisers. In recent years, broadcast networks have begun negotiating carriage fees from cable, satellite and telephone providers, so those companies are now also customers.&lt;br/&gt;\nProduct: Viewers (adults 18-49 in primetime) to advertisers. Programming feed to providers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ad Supported Cable Networks:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Customers: Same customers as the broadcast TV networks, but currently reversed in importance. Carriage fees are more important to most (all?) ad supported cable networks than is advertising revenue.&lt;br/&gt;\nProduct: Viewers (various age/gender demo groups) to advertisers. Programming feed to providers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Premium Cable Networks: (HBO, Showtime, etc)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Customers: Primarily subscribers, but carriage providers as well, who act as the &amp;quot;retailers&amp;quot; of their product.&lt;br/&gt;\nProduct: Programming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TV Studios:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Customers: Broadcast and cable networks, both for first run and syndication. DVD buyers. Online streaming companies (Netflix, Hulu, Amazon, etc).&lt;br/&gt;\nProduct: TV programs.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So they do not have to ensure that you are coming back after each episode on a very specific day at a very specific time. They have to ensure that you aren&amp;#39;t going to cancel the subscription and for that it is way more important that the whole season is great than that each episode is. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "link_id": "t3_1yf0hw", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cfkimmk", "created": 1392965125.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1392936325.0, "distinguished": null, "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "banned_by": null, "subreddit": "changemyview", "likes": null, "replies": "", "saved": false, "id": "cfk3g6w", "gilded": 0, "author": "DaftMythic", "parent_id": "t3_1yf0hw", "approved_by": null, "body": "I think you are making a conflation between a conceptual unit and a delivery unit.\n\nTaken to your logical conclusion you might argue that each page in any textual literature must take advantage of the page nature of the medium.

Movies used to come in reels of physical film and many early films had a certain formula based on which reel you were in. The love scene on reel 3 the chase on reel 5 always finish by reel 8. That's fine but following or breaking that formula does not make a film better or worse. There are Hindi movies that still follow that sort of formulaic style, between reel 3-4, 6-7 9-10  there is always obligatory dance scenes even if it breaks the flow of the story the first half of the movie before intermission has a sort of completeness to it, and the last half is sort of complete to itself too, with an obligatory dance scene.\n\nBut reels are outdated now, the technology has moved on and continuous films of whatever length the author wants are accepted.
